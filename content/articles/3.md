Having analyzed the overall sentiment towards different topics related to the war, we now 
combine this with a focus on networks. As mentioned at the outset, we hypothesize that war will have a polarizing effect on the communities within the network of Ukrainian and Russian users tweeting on topics related to the war. The rationale being that in times of war people can be expected to tone down criticism towards ‘their side’ and conversely also drop any nuances about ‘the other side’, which instead becomes the epitome of evil. For example, the Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy has been involved in a number of corruption scandals. His approval rating was below 40% immediately before the war, but has subsequently risen to [over 90%](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2ufsn/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_is_having_90/). With examples like these, we expect to see an increasing difference in the sentiment between and decrease in interaction between these communities over time as the war progresses.  

# Community division based on ‘Ukraine support’ metric

For the rest of this project we will use and test the quality of the division of the network into communities based on their ‘Ukraine support’ sentiment score. This approach has potential issues. Firstly, it is a questionable metric due to ambiguities of how to interpret negative or positive sentiments as mentioned earlier. Secondly, consider which conclusions can be drawn if we find that this is a bad community split (which the next section indeed does) using methods such as the modularity score of the split. In that case, there are a number of scenarios which can explain such a finding:

- 1) Either it is the case that the ‘Ukraine support’ score is uninformative of actually existing communities in the network. This would entail that the ‘Ukraine support’ metric is flawed.
- 2) Alternatively, the ‘Ukraine support’ metric accurately captures the sentiment of the users, but this sentiment is just not a good community split. This would entail that the war does not have a polarizing effect on the network structure, since users with different opinions continue to interact with each other.
- 3) Lastly, it is possible that Twitter is just not a very community oriented forum, but instead mostly a place where individuals scream into the void. 

If the third scenario holds true, we should be able to identify this by analyzing properties of the graph such as the in- and out-degree distribution. A later section shows that this is actually the case. However, this does not exclude either scenario one or two. 

In order to alleviate some of this ambiguity, a final section introduces a new metric, which looks at changes in interactions and once-removed interactions from the first 10 days compared to the last 10 days of the dataset. This will be explained then, but first we examine the communities in the network using the community detection algorithms that we learned in this course.

# Initial graph analysis

Initially we constructed a directed graph, where users replying to or retweeting other users' Tweets are nodes with outgoing edges and users whose Tweets are replied to conversely have ingoing edges. In our network with 7068 Ukrainian and Russian there are 191595 Tweets which are shown as edges in the following figure:
